Domain Agnostic Recommender System - Dashboard & Recommendations Implementation
Now that you've successfully implemented authentication, login, and user creation, let's proceed with implementing the dashboard and recommendation features. This is where the domain-specific aspects of our system become crucial.
Step 2: Dashboard & Recommendations Implementation
2.1: Dashboard Structure & Components
Your dashboard should include the following key components:

Welcome Header: Display the user's name and a welcome message.
Top Picks for You Section:

This section displays personalized recommendations from the API
These are tailored to the user based on their past ratings and preferences
Fetch these from the /recommendations/user endpoint
Each recommendation should be clickable to view details


Trending Now Section:

This section shows popular items in the user's chosen domain
Since our API doesn't have a dedicated endpoint for trending items, use mock data
This data should still be domain-specific (movies vs products)
Each trending item should also be clickable


Item Details View:

When a user clicks on any item (recommendation or trending), show detailed information
This should appear prominently, perhaps as a modal or a dedicated section
Include larger image, name, and a rating interface
Below the details, show "Similar Items" fetched from the API


Similar Items Section:

This appears within the Item Details View
Shows items similar to the selected item
Fetch these from the /recommendations/similar endpoint
Display as a horizontal row of smaller item cards
Each similar item should also be clickable to view its details



2.2: Domain & Dataset Management

Extract and store the user's domain preferences:
javascript// Extract from user profile
let currentDomain = '';
let currentDataset = '';

if (userProfile.domain_preferences) {
  const domains = Object.keys(userProfile.domain_preferences);
  if (domains.length > 0) {
    // Get the first domain with non-empty dataset array
    for (const domain of domains) {
      if (userProfile.domain_preferences[domain].length > 0) {
        currentDomain = domain;
        currentDataset = userProfile.domain_preferences[domain][0];
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}

// Fallback defaults if somehow not set
if (!currentDomain || !currentDataset) {
  currentDomain = 'entertainment';
  currentDataset = 'movielens';
}

console.log(`User domain: ${currentDomain}, dataset: ${currentDataset}`);

CRITICAL: These domain and dataset values must be used consistently in all API calls.
