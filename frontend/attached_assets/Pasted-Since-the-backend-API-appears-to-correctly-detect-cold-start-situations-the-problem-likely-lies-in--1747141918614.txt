Since the backend API appears to correctly detect cold-start situations, the problem likely lies in the frontend implementation.

Here are some things to check and fix in your frontend:

Proper API Request Format:

Make sure you're sending the exact format expected by the backend:

javascript{
  "user_id": "user-id-from-localStorage", // Must be a string
  "domain": "entertainment", // or "ecommerce" based on user's preference
  "dataset": "movielens", // or "amazon" based on domain
  "count": 10 
}

Double-check that user_id is sent as a string, not a number


Response Handling:

Check how your frontend handles the "cold_start" status in the API response
When the API returns:

json{
  "status": "cold_start",
  "message": "Please rate some items to get personalized recommendations",
  "recommendations": []
}

Your frontend should display that message to the user and show the "Trending Now" section instead


Rating Submission:

Verify that rating submissions are successful by checking the API response
Implement proper error handling for rating submission
Make sure ratings are being sent with the correct user_id, domain, and dataset


Checking Network Requests:

Use browser developer tools to inspect the network requests
Verify that rating submissions are getting 200 OK responses
Check that recommendation requests are being made with the correct parameters


Debug with Console Logs:

Add detailed console logs for API requests and responses
Specifically log the user_id, domain, and dataset being used in requests


Check Local Storage:

Ensure user_id and token are properly stored in localStorage
Verify they're being correctly retrieved for API calls


Add Special Frontend Handling:

Update your frontend to explicitly keep track of how many ratings a user has submitted
Implement a counter in localStorage: localStorage.setItem('ratingCount', count)
Only show "Top Picks for You" when ratingCount >= 10
Show a progress indicator: "Rate 10 items to get personalized recommendations: 3/10"



Here's some suggested code to add to your frontend to implement this rating counter approach:
javascript// When submitting a rating
async function submitRating(itemId, rating) {
  try {
    const userId = localStorage.getItem('user_id');
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    const domain = currentDomain; // From user preferences
    const dataset = currentDataset; // From user preferences
    
    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/user/rate`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        user_id: userId,
        item_id: itemId,
        rating: rating,
        domain: domain,
        dataset: dataset
      })
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      // Increment rating count in localStorage
      let ratingCount = parseInt(localStorage.getItem('ratingCount') || '0');
      ratingCount++;
      localStorage.setItem('ratingCount', ratingCount.toString());
      
      // Update UI to show progress
      updateRatingProgress(ratingCount);
      
      // If we've reached the threshold, reload recommendations
      if (ratingCount >= 10) {
        await loadRecommendations();
      }
      
      return true;
    } else {
      console.error('Rating submission failed:', await response.json());
      return false;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error submitting rating:', error);
    return false;
  }
}

// Function to update the UI with rating progress
function updateRatingProgress(count) {
  const progressElement = document.getElementById('rating-progress');
  if (progressElement) {
    if (count < 10) {
      progressElement.textContent = `Rate ${10 - count} more items to get personalized recommendations`;
      progressElement.classList.remove('hidden');
    } else {
      progressElement.classList.add('hidden');
    }
  }
}
This approach adds frontend-specific handling for the cold-start situation, keeping track of the number of ratings independently from the backend. This should help ensure users can see when they'll start getting personalized recommendations, even if there's an issue with how the backend is determining cold-start status.
